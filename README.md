Hi, I'm Sergiy.

I love climbing (especially the outdoor), working out in the gym (my bench press max is 115 kg * 3 reps) and 2 my badass cats.

Also I'm a Ruby Full Stack Engineer with more than 7 years of professional experience.

During my career I was working in different domains:
* Gifting platform ([&Open](https://andopen.co/) - IE remote)

* Education ([TeamSatchel](https://www.teamsatchel.com/) - UK remote)

* Online marketing ([CopeCart](https://copecart.com/) Perfectial UA)
